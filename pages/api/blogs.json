They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication. ",

Use same authorize like GET and set the body to json contain object message, content and sha. Message is information to our commit, while content is our data will be inserted. Remember to change or encode the content to base64. This link will help you to do it https://www.base64encode.org/. While sha is last condition of our commit must updated continuesly.
